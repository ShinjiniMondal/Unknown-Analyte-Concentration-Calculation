# Unknown-Analyte-Concentration-Calculation
This repository contains a Python code for estimating the concentration of an unknown sample of PPO, bis-MSB or both by comparing the area under curve of the spectrum plot for UV-Vis Absorbance data to a calibration curve generated using repeated measurements of samples of different concentrations. This calibration is based on Beer-Lambert's Law.
